## Summary:

Left-Handed batters showcase the highest batting statistics in Major League 
Baseball.

## Design:

I combined both batting average and home runs into a single variable, 
performance, to more easily compare batting statistics.

Performance Equation:

$$Performance = \sqrt{{batting.avg * home.runs}}$$

The design of the equation is based on the idea that having a high batting average
and high number of home runs are both desired factors for a great batter. 
Multiplying both values equally distributes the importance of the two factors.
Because two variables were being multipled the square root is included to reduce
the range to make easier comparisons.

Created the performance variable enabled me to create both a histogram and 
boxplot. The histogram showcases close to normal distribtion with values ranging
0-12 with a tail to the right. The boxplot was split by handedness and displays 
left-handers have higher median values of performance.

A text table was included to showcase the actual median values split by batter.

Version 1 -

The initial design was much more exploratory and didn't make any absolute 
observations. The main chart was of batting.avg vs home.runs by player. Although
everybody that reviewed really liked how they could explore the graph it wasn't
easily understood and no easily absolute observations could be made.
