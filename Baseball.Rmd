## Summary:

Left-Handed batters showcase the highest batting statistics in Major League 
Baseball.

## Design: 

### Final Chart: 

[Lifetime Batting Performance for MLB](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david2106#!/vizhome/Baseball_38/Story1)

I combined both batting average and home runs into a single variable, 
performance, to more easily compare batting statistics.

Performance Equation:

$$Performance = \sqrt{{batting.avg * home.runs}}$$

The design of the equation is based on the idea that having a high batting average
and high number of home runs are both desired factors for a great batter. 
Multiplying both values equally distributes the importance of the two factors.
Because two variables were being multipled the square root is included to reduce
the range to make easier comparisons. This is equivalent to the geometric 
average of the two values.

Created the performance variable enabled me to create both a histogram and 
boxplot. The histogram showcases close to normal distribtion with values ranging
0-12 with a tail to the right. The boxplot was split by handedness and displays 
left-handers have higher median values of performance.

A text table was included to showcase the actual median values split by batter.

### Previous Charts:

[Version 1](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david2106#!/vizhome/BaseballDraft1/Sheet7)

The initial design was much more exploratory and didn't make any absolute 
observations. The most confusing part is there was too much to look at on the 
page which made it difficult for observers to understand what I was trying to 
showcase. In the next version I blatantly mention left-handers showcase better
performance.

Both batting.avg and total.home.runs were condensed into one variable, 
performance. This allowed me to compare 1 variable to handedness instead of 
multiple variables (subsequently splitting data by color was no longer needed).

The chart was split into multiple graphs: a histogram to show the distribution 
of scores, box plots to compare handedness, and a table to see the actual 
numbers.
